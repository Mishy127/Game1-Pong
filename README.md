So, my friend challenged me into completing this _20 games challenge_ and gave me a 2 years window to do so
If I manage then she works for me on my next project, if I don't then I work for hers instead

I really think the time windows is way too generous... but I already wasted a week procastinating on making pong :skull_emoji:
An extra rule I gave myself is that I cannot use the same programming language for two consecutive projects
But I will try to avoid repeating languages as much as possible...

After a week of "preparation" I finished it in a little over 4 and a half hours, I don't know how bad that time is...
And this is the easy part, the first 10 are known titles, like pong or breakout
I better learn how to manage resources and time otherwise, the other half will be living hell...

Also it was fun using c++ again after a while...
Been using zig way too much

Left the timer at
    11:24:09
    11 hours, 24 minutes and 9 seconds

A little note:
I had already done Flappy Bird and Pong, so I tried making an amalgam of both to spice things up...
The result was more similar to Jetpack Joyride than either of the previously mentioned, which was when I realized I wasn't making what I was supposed to
So I started over and made this one instead, and I didn't reset the timer

The next one will be either Breakout or Jetpack Joyride...
